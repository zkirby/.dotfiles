 I think the consistency is fine. I don't feel a need to try new activities and I've more or less settled into what I have now. With that being said, I haven't taken full advantage of the new environment I'm in. Next quarter, I'd like to aim to fully lean into the city and really develop a game plan and habit pattern that incentive aligns with my goals. I.e., become the machine.
